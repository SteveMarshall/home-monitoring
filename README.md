# `home-monitoring`

Configuration and tools to manage my home monitoring systems.

It will monitor a number of things for us:

- Internet connection: looking at upload and download speeds, but
  also the quality of the connection
- Unifi network infrastructure: (hopefully) filling some gaps in the
  capabilities of the Unifi management software
- Solar power generation: how much is our solar array generating, how
  much are we using/exporting, and so on
